                <p class="bio-text">
                    I’m <strong>Gurpreet Bhatti</strong>, and my passion lies in helping clients achieve their goals using both my military and engineering perspective. After retiring from the military and earning degrees in mechanical and structural engineering, I embarked on an exciting journey in real estate.
                </p>
                <p class="bio-text">
                    My experience started long before my real estate journey while running successful retail businesses, including smoke shops, gas stations, and warehouses. After gaining a deep understanding of the market and a sharp eye for high-margin investments, I realized I could help others achieve their investment goals by becoming their realtor.
                </p>
                <p class="bio-text">
                    Whether it’s residential or commercial (gas stations, strip plazas, hotels/motels, or commercial/residential lands), I specialize in evaluating opportunities, analyzing cap rates, and ensuring optimal returns. Negotiation is my forte—I always strive for the best financial outcomes for my clients.
                </p>
                <p class="bio-text">
                    Beyond my professional life, I’m an outdoor enthusiast. Whether it’s camping, hunting, fishing, boating, running, or cycling, nature fuels my spirit. In summer, you’ll find me camping with my family and friends; in the winter, I’m carving slopes on my snowboard.
                </p>
                <p class="bio-text">
                    Whether we share the same personal passions or they differ, it would be my pleasure to serve you in achieving your real estate goals. Whether you’re a first-time buyer, seasoned investor, or selling your property, I’m here with expert guidance and personalized solutions.
